## Author's Note
This project helped me realize my goal of creating a full stack web app (while trying to use best practices). I think that I should always make projects that are interesting, useful, and fun with good UI/UX. Thus, I decided to have a go at a fresh take on productivity apps as it's one of my interests. 
I hope this project is unique and effective to all who use it!
